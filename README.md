# 2NiteAHI
About:  
      This is an app built by the FSU Powerhouse.
      It's designed using Xamarin with Visual Studios.
      2Nite is meant to pull the users location, then query for bars within a 1000 meter radius of that location
        and attached to those bars are the counts of users at each one. 
      There are many premium features in progress and TBD.

Branches:
      MASTER:   Holds our original design with a Login and Maps in process.
      LOGIN:    Holds the mostly-built login system in addition to what is in the Master branch.
      LOCLIST:  Reevaluted version of the app with the pages rerouted from login and map to a list format.
      DEE-LOCLIST:  Branched from LOCLIST for Ladarrius to experiment with several potential ideas.
      QUERY:    Branched from LOCLIST to design the query for bars based on the users location and then return local bars.

Comments:
  [cd] In the beginning of our second month of development, we reevaluated our minimum viable product due to a missing team member.
        Achieving less then expected during the first week of that month, we decided to cut the login system and 
        shift from an interactive map to a list format for proof of concept. The list format achieves the same function, 
        but requires less customization. After the second month, we hope to mainly focus on 
        integrating the live map, a login system, and several setting options with all the other expansion ideas as a secondary focus.
