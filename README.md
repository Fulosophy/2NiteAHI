# 2NiteAHI
About:  
      This is an app built by the FSU Powerhouse.
      It's designed using Xamarin with Visual Studios.
      2Nite is meant to pull the users location, then query for bars within a 1000 meter radius of that location
        and attached to those bars are the counts of users at each one. 
      There are many premium features in progress and TBD.

Main Branches:
      MASTER:   Holds our original design with a Login and Maps in process.
      LOGIN:    Holds the mostly-built login system in addition to what is in the Master branch.
      LOCLIST:  Reevaluted version of the app with the pages rerouted from login and map to a list format.
      DEE-LOCLIST:  Branched from LOCLIST for Ladarrius.
      QUERY:    Branched from LOCLIST to design the query for bars based on the users location and then return local bars.
      QUERY_FOOD:   Branched from QUERY to build in the food section of our lists and add further locations. This will be the last branch before final merging into MASTER.

Comments:
  [cd] We discovered that Google API's charge you per session and greatly impact a developers ability to generate income from an app. After much research, I've decided my interest in mobile dev is geared much more towards iOS and plan to avoid Android dev in the future if possible.
